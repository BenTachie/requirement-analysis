# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to my **Requirement Analysis** project- a real-world simulation of documenting and analysing the foundational needs of a software system before development begins.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a structured space to capture the complete requirement analysis process for a **Booking Management System**. It focuses on creating industry-standard documentation that clearly defines:

- Project scope and stakeholder needs
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Visual system representations using diagrams
- Use case definitions and acceptance criteria

Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the critical thinking and planning required in the **Requirement Analysis phase of the SDLC**, ensuring that systems are built on clarity, structure, and user-aligned expectations.

>  "Well-defined requirements are the blueprint of great software."

##  Next Steps

Stay tuned as I add requirement gathering techniques, system diagrams, and detailed use cases in the coming commits.
